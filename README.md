# SP500-Directional-Prediction-Project 
This project explores machine learning techniques for predicting next-day S&P 500 direction using historical price data. The pipeline includes time-series feature engineering (momentum, trend, and volatility signals), Random Forest classification, and probability threshold tuning. Model performance is evaluated using an expanding-window rolling backtest to prevent look-ahead bias and simulate realistic out-of-sample conditions. Performance is assessed using precision metrics and risk-adjusted return measures.

Note: Results reflect a historical snapshot at the time of analysis and are not intended for live trading.
